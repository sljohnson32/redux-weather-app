## Reflection

This was a group project during Module 3 at Turing School of Software & Design.  

As a group of three, we set out to build a clean, well-built React-Redux web application.  This was my first exposure to Redux and this project was a great learning experience - I really enjoyed learning Redux and the simplicity it creates for handling data in a React app.
